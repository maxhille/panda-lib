README for panda-lib 0.1.1

This is a small lib providing easy access to the API of the pandastream
cloud video transcoding service (http://www.pandastream.com).

If you need more of the API reflected or improvement/bugfixes feel free
to contact me per <mh@lambdasoup.com>.

USAGE

Instanciate the Panda client with

Panda panda = new Panda(accessKey, cloudId, secretKey, apiHost);

then upload a video file with

Video video = panda.postRemoteVideo("http://panda-test-harness-videos.s3.amazonaws.com/panda.mp4");

this Video object now holds the id the pandastream.com service generated for it.

To get the encodings that are produced after your upload use

Collection<Encoding> encodings = panda.getEncodings(video.id);



For further usage see test class.
